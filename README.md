# Pokemon Text Adventure

Welcome to Pokemon Text Adventure, a text-based RPG game inspired by the Pokémon series. This project is designed to run in the terminal and provides a nostalgic experience similar to the classic text-based RPG games.

## Project Description

Pokemon Text Adventure is a demake of the beloved Pokémon games, created to help me learn game design, logic, and the Python programming language. This project takes inspiration from games of the past, bringing the charm of text-based adventures to a modern audience. Players can explore a world, capture Pokémon, and battle trainers, all through text commands.

## Project Goals

If I could get to beating Brock at the first gym that would be a great goal for the project.
